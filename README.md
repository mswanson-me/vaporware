## Synopsis

This project is an exercise in retrieving and handling with Python. The objective is to gather data from Steam, the game distribution platform from Valve, parse through and graph relevant data, draw insights from the data, and report on these insights.

## Requirements

This script relies on **pandas**, which in turn relies on **numpy**. Beyond that, the script will require a **Steam API key** and a **Steam user ID** as input. Since these values are sensitive, I have masked my API key and Steam ID.

## Lessons Learned

* Retrieving and storing JSON data
* Parsing through and extracting subsets of JSON data
* Python classes

## To-do list

* Create additional classes to handle different API calls
  (This is necessary since each API method requires different arguments and API call format.)
