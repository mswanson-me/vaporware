## Synopsis

This project is an exercise in data analysis with Python. The objective is to retrieve data from Steam, the game distribution platform from Valve, parse through and graph relevant data, draw insights from the data, and report on these insights.

## WIP

This readme file will be updated shortly, as the project takes shape.
